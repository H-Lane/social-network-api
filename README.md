# social-network-api

Week 18 Challenge

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a basic API using a non-SQL database, in this case MongoDB and the Mongoose package, to create an API for a social media site to store user data on. This project was meant to help me further learn the benefits of using non-sql databases and get comfortable implementing them into a realistic setting. Throughout this project I became adept at the various query syntax of Mongoose and the benefits of an unstructured Database in production applications.
